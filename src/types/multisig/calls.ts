     * - Up to one binary search and insert (`O(logS + S)`).
     * - I/O: 1 read `O(S)`, up to 1 mutate `O(S)`. Up to one remove.
     * - One event.
     * - The weight of the `call`.
     * - Storage: inserts one item, value size bounded by `MaxSignatories`, with a deposit
     *   taken for its lifetime of `DepositBase + threshold * DepositFactor`.
