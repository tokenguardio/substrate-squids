 * Instantiates a new contract from the supplied `code` optionally transferring

 * 
 * This dispatchable has the same effect as calling [`Self::upload_code`] +
 * [`Self::instantiate`]. Bundling them together provides efficiency gains. Please
 * also check the documentation of [`Self::upload_code`].
 * 
 * # Parameters
 * 
 * * `value`: The balance to transfer from the `origin` to the newly created contract.
 * * `gas_limit`: The gas limit enforced when executing the constructor.
 * * `storage_deposit_limit`: The maximum amount of balance that can be charged/reserved
 *   from the caller to pay for the storage consumed.
 * * `code`: The contract code to deploy in raw bytes.
 * * `data`: The input data to pass to the contract constructor.
 * * `salt`: Used for the address derivation. See [`Pallet::contract_address`].
 * 
 * Instantiation is executed as follows:
 * 
 * - The supplied `code` is instrumented, deployed, and a `code_hash` is created for that
 *   code.
 * - If the `code_hash` already exists on the chain the underlying `code` will be shared.
 * - The destination address is computed based on the sender, code_hash and the salt.
 * - The smart-contract account is created at the computed address.
 * - The `value` is transferred to the new account.
 * - The `deploy` function is executed in the context of the newly-created account.
